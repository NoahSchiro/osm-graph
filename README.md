# osm-graph

This repo will take a query to the [Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API) and convert it into a standard [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) data structure. I often times find a need to be able to make toy / example graphs quickly, and this can provide graphs very quickly. Additionally, this could be used for mapping applications.
